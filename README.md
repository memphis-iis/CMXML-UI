# CMXML-UI

CMXML-UI is a minimal GUI frontend for Coh-MetrixML.

# TODO
* Fix `txtStdOut` to be scrollable
* General aesthetic improvements - Use QLayouts to either make the whole app resizable or fix the size of the whole window
* Use a `QThreadPool` approach with signals slots to allow correct UI updating from reader thread
* Native error handling to notify user and prevent malformed calls to backend
